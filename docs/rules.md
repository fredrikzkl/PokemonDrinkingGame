# Rules

## Basics

1. Roll a die to move forward
2. You may only leave the table when it is not your turn. No fleeing from battles!
3. Breaking any rules results in a drink
4. If you land on the same square as someone, you must challenge them to a trainer battle
5. Gold squares are gyms. You must stop at all gold squares, whether or not your die roll places you beyond them. If you have completed a Gym, you neither have to re-do it nor stop at it.
6. Players in a gym are immune to movement effects from others, and cannot be challenged to trainer battles.
7. Colored squares belong to a "Zone", where additional rules are in effect. Expect more drinks!
8. Forced movement from other players doesn't trigger the square you land on, unless it has a **Start of turn** effect.
9. **Start of turn:** tiles with this keyword trigger every turn you remain there, including if forced there by another player.

## Starter Draft

Before the game begins, each player secretly writes down their starter Pokemon: **Bulbasaur**, **Charmander**, or **Squirtle**. Reveal all at once.

Your starter determines type advantage in Trainer Battles (roll 2 dice, take the higher):

- Bulbasaur (Grass) > Squirtle (Water)
- Squirtle (Water) > Charmander (Fire)
- Charmander (Fire) > Bulbasaur (Grass)

## Drinking

The standard drink is a 0.33 beer, with 4.5% abv. One "drink", consists of 10 sips.

*Important*: It's only allowed to fill up your cup (drink), when it's empty. A lot of mechanics in the game rely on the progress of your drink.

## Trainer Battle

If you land on the same square as another player, you must battle!

1. Both players roll a die. Highest roll wins.
2. If your starter is super effective against theirs, roll 2 dice and take the higher.
3. Loser drinks 2.
4. Tie: both drink 1.

## Items

**Pokeball / Safari Ball:** When landing on a Pokemon square, you may throw your ball *before* the effect occurs. Roll 4-6 to catch (Safari Ball: see Safari Zone rules). If caught, the square's effect is skipped and you keep the Pokemon for later use. **Master Ball** has a 100% catch rate.

**Using a caught Pokemon:** On your turn, before your movement roll, you may use a caught Pokemon's move on any player of your choice. The effect resolves immediately. Each caught Pokemon can only be used once.

**Repel:** Declare *before* the effect occurs. Skip the Pokemon encounter entirely.

**Potion:** Can be used at any time when you are about to drink. Negates 1 drinking effect from any source.

## Gym Mechanics

Grab 3 dice. Split them however you like between Attack and Defence.
Gym stats are shown as **ATK/HP**
(e.g. 3/4 = 3 Attack, 4 Health).

Each round has two phases:

1. **You attack:** Your highest ATK die = your damage. If it equals or beats their remaining HP, you win! Otherwise, their HP is reduced by your damage.

2. **They attack:** Their ATK vs your highest DEF die. If their ATK is higher, you faint and restart the fight from scratch.

If both survive, the fight continues on your next turn.

Each gym has:

**Special:** A unique rule for this fight
**Faint:** Penalty when you faint
**Flash:** Reward for winning without fainting

### Example

**Pewter Gym - Onix: 3/4** (3 ATK, 4 HP). Faint: Drink 2. Flash: Get a Pokeball!

You split your 3 dice: 2 for Attack, 1 for Defence.

**Round 1:** You roll ATK: 4, 3. Highest = 4. Onix HP is 4. 4 >= 4: Onix is defeated! Flash: You get a Pokeball!

Now imagine your ATK was lower:

**Round 1:** You roll ATK: 3, 2. Highest = 3. Onix has 4 HP. 3 < 4, Onix survives at 1 HP. Onix attacks: its ATK (3) vs your DEF die (5). 3 < 5: you defend!

**Round 2:** You roll ATK: 2, 1. Highest = 2. Onix has 1 HP. 2 >= 1: Onix is down! Flash: Pokeball!

**Faint scenario:** Onix ATK (3) vs your DEF die (2). 3 > 2: you faint! Drink 2, restart the fight (Onix back to full HP).
