3. Breaking any rules, results in a drink
4. If you land on the same square as someone, you must challenge them to a trainer battle
5. Gold squares a gyms. You must stop at all gold squares, whether or not your die roll places you beyond them. If you have completed a Gym, you don't have to re-do it if you land on the same square later.
6. Players in a gym battle are immune to movement effects caused by others.

You start the whole encounter from the start.
