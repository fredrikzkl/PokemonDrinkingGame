# Rules

## Basics

1. Roll a die to move forward
2. You may only leave the table when it is not your turn. No fleeing from battles!
3. Breaking any rules, results in a drink
4. If you land on the same square as someone, you must challenge them to a trainer battle
5. Gold squares a gyms. You must stop at all gold squares, whether or not your die roll places you beyond them. If you have completed a Gym, you don't have to re-do it if you land on the same square later.
6. Players in a gym battle are immune to movement effects caused by others.
7. Colored squares belongs to a "Zone", where additional rules are in effect. Expect more drinks!
8. Gray squares are optional stops. You may choose to stop at a gray square when passing through it, even if your roll would take you further.
9. Forced movement from other players doesn't trigger the square you land on, unless it has a "Start of turn" effect.
10. **Start of turn:** tiles with this keyword trigger every turn you remain there, including if forced there by another player.

## Drinking

The standard drink is a 0.33 beer, with 4.5% abv. One "drink", consists of 10 sips.

*Important*: It's only allowed to fill up your glass (drink), when it's empty. A lot of mechanics in the game rely on the progress of your drink.

## Trainer Battle

## Gym Mechanics

Grab 3 dice. Split them as you like: Attack & Defence.

1. You attack: Highest attack die = your damage.
Beat their hp? You win instantly. If they survive, their hp is reduced until next round.

2. They attack: Their attack versus your highest defence die. If their attack is greater than your defence, you faint.
You start the whole encounter from the start.

Opponent

* Special: Special rule for this fight
* Faint: What happens if you faint
* Flash: What happens if you win, without fainting

Example:
Onix: 2 / 3
Onix has 2 in attack, 3 health

Faint: Drink 4
Flash: Give 1 drink
