# Rules

## Basics

1. Roll a die to move forward
2. You may only leave the table when it is not your turn. No fleeing from battles!
3. Breaking any rules results in a drink
4. If you land on the same square as someone, you must challenge them to a trainer battle
5. Gold squares are gyms. You must stop at all gold squares, whether or not your die roll places you beyond them. If you have completed a Gym, you don't have to re-do it if you land on the same square later.
6. Players on a gold square are immune to movement effects from others, and cannot be challenged to trainer battles.
7. Colored squares belong to a "Zone", where additional rules are in effect. Expect more drinks!
8. Forced movement from other players doesn't trigger the square you land on, unless it has a "Start of turn" effect.
9. **Start of turn:** tiles with this keyword trigger every turn you remain there, including if forced there by another player.

## Starter Draft

Before the game begins, each player secretly writes down their starter Pokemon: **Bulbasaur**, **Charmander**, or **Squirtle**. Reveal all at once.

Your starter determines type advantage in Trainer Battles (roll 2 dice, take the higher):
- Bulbasaur (Grass) > Squirtle (Water)
- Squirtle (Water) > Charmander (Fire)
- Charmander (Fire) > Bulbasaur (Grass)

## Drinking

The standard drink is a 0.33 beer, with 4.5% abv. One "drink", consists of 10 sips.

*Important*: It's only allowed to fill up your cup (drink), when it's empty. A lot of mechanics in the game rely on the progress of your drink.

## Trainer Battle

If you land on the same square as another player, you must battle!

1. Both players roll a die. Highest roll wins.
2. If your starter is super effective against theirs, roll 2 dice and take the higher.
3. Loser drinks 2.
4. Tie: both drink 1.

## Items

**Pokeball / Safari Ball:** When landing on a Pokemon square, you may throw your ball *before* the effect occurs. Roll 4-6 to catch (Safari Ball: see Safari Zone rules). If caught, the square's effect is skipped and you keep the Pokemon for later use. **Master Ball** has a 100% catch rate.

**Using a caught Pokemon:** On your turn, before your movement roll, you may use a caught Pokemon's move on any player of your choice. The effect resolves immediately. Each caught Pokemon can only be used once.

**Repel:** Declare *before* the effect occurs. Skip the Pokemon encounter entirely.

**Potion:** Can be used at any time when you are about to drink. Negates 1 drinking effect from any source.

## Gym Mechanics

Grab 3 dice. Split them as you like: Attack & Defence.

1. You attack: Highest attack die = your damage.
Beat their hp? You win instantly. If they survive, their hp is reduced until next round.

2. They attack: Their attack versus your highest defence die. If their attack is greater than your defence, you faint.
You start the whole encounter from the start.

Opponent

* Special: Special rule for this fight
* Faint: What happens if you faint
* Flash: What happens if you win, without fainting

Example:
Onix: 2 / 3
Onix has 2 in attack, 3 health

Faint: Drink 4
Flash: Give 1 drink
